# Go API Server for swagger

It is an URL shortener service - it can generate a short version of arbitrary user's URL. Also user can get statistics for URL generated url (how much people followed the link).

## Overview

By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
